This project extracts questions from books or papers using OCR and classifies them. It also uses computer vision to analyze facial expressions to understand user engagement.

## Features

- OCR using Tesseract
- Question classification (MCQ, Descriptive, etc.)
- Real-time facial expression analysis using OpenCV

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt`

## How to Run

1. Place a sample image (`test.jpg`) with a question in the folder.
2. Make sure `emotion_model.h5` is in the folder.
3. Run `main.py`
